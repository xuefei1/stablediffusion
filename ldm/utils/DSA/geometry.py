Problem: Counting Rectangles in a 2D Grid

Given a list of points in a 2D plane, each point represented as a tuple (x, y), write a Python program to count the number of rectangles that can be formed with sides parallel to the axes. A rectangle is defined by four points that form its vertices, and all sides of the rectangle must be of positive length.

Constraints:
The list of points may contain duplicates, but each point should be considered only once.
All coordinates are integers.
The sides of the rectangles are aligned with the x and y axes (axis-aligned rectangles).

Input: points = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is one rectangle formed by the points (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).

Write a Python function to determine whether a given point is inside a simple polygon. The polygon is represented as a list of its vertex coordinates in order (either clockwise or counterclockwise). The point is given as a tuple (x, y). Implement the ray casting algorithm to solve this problem.
